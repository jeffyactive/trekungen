=========

This project is intended to serve as an example of how GeoJSON data may facilitate the discovery of content through a simple web application built on standard open source and open data platforms.

Although the individual platforms and standards are well documented, combining them all together often remains a challenge, hence the motivation for this repository and its documentation, which I hope proves useful to many (my future self included).

The code and its dependencies are all open source and permissively licensed, facilitating the forking and adaptation of this project for purposes other than documenting travels, as is the case here.  In cases where it is possible to do so, I invite you to similarly share your adaptations with the developer community and, most importantly, extend the documentation with a level of care that your future self too would appreciate.
